# Percules Bong Simulator

A physically accurate and modular simulation of bong acoustics, using fluid dynamics and real-time audio synthesis in the browser.

## Goals
- Simulate discrete air/water volumes
- Model bubble formation and flow
- Generate sound from physical pressure data
- Support different shapes and acoustic profiles
